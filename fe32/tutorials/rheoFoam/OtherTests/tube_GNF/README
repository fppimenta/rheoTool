--> Purpose

	The tests in this folder compare the blood rheology when using different models. They provide a template for the use of each GNF model, regarding the constitutiveProperties dict.
	
--> Geometry

	The geometry is a slice of a tube, where axisymmetric conditions are assumed. The tube has radius R=1.5 mm and it is 15 cm long, approximamtely modeling a segment of a "perfectly cylindrical" artery. The ratio L/R (L-length) is made so high because the flow is simulated at a high Reynolds number, with non-developed conditions imposed at the inlet.
	
--> Boundary conditions

	A fixed velocity is imposed at the inlet, aiming to simulate the flow at a Reynolds number of ~400 for the Newtonian case.
	
--> Fluid properties

	-density: 1050 kg/m3 (common to all rheological models);
	
	Remaining parameters related with the viscosity are model-dependent and where obtained from the following references:
